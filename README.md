# Audio-Controller For Web Pages
Follows on from the audio graphics generator project: https://github.com/WhiteLightningGun/AudioWaveFormSVG

If you're not using a front-end framework this is an adequate implementation of a purely static audio controller, beyond the basic default slider.

By the time I got to the end of the project it was VERY clear that something of this kind is best done with Canvas and a means to pass data to the canvas from the backend. Even mere positioning the waveform controller is far simpler if you use a Canvas.
